# Causal ML Roadmap - Quick Start

## Learning Path

1. **Foundation (Week 1-2)**
   - Correlation vs causation
   - Confounding variables
   - Treatment effects (ATE, ATT, CATE)
   - Selection bias

2. **Core Methods (Week 3-4)**
   - Propensity score matching
   - Inverse propensity weighting (IPW)
   - Doubly robust estimation
   - Meta-learners (S, T, X learners)

3. **Advanced Techniques (Week 5-6)**
   - Causal trees/forests
   - Uplift modeling
   - Heterogeneous treatment effects
   - Sensitivity analysis

4. **Business Application (Week 7-8)**
   - A/B test analysis
   - Marketing intervention optimization
   - Policy evaluation
   - Customer segmentation by treatment response

## Key Concepts

**Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**: Average impact across all units
**Conditional ATE (CATE)**: Treatment effect varies by individual characteristics
**Uplift**: Who benefits most from treatment vs control
